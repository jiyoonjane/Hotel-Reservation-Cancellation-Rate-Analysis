# Hotel-Reservation-Cancellation-Rate-Analysis
# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Topic Selection & Project Objectives

### Background

* Reservation cancellation rates directly impact a hotelâ€™s profitability and operational efficiency.
* High cancellation rates make it difficult to forecast room availability, creating challenges for operations teams.
* Analyzing factors such as customer segment, booking channel, seasonality, and lead time can uncover drivers of cancellations and inform strategies to minimize them.

### Narrative Scenario

> The hotel operations team is struggling with unpredictable room availability and revenue forecasting due to high cancellation rates. What strategies can reduce cancellations and stabilize operations?

### Project Goals

This project leverages data visualization and analysis in Python to uncover cancellation patterns and recommend optimization strategies. Specific objectives include:

1. Analyze cancellation patterns by customer segment (e.g., corporate vs. leisure).
2. Examine seasonal trends in cancellation rates.
3. Investigate booking-level factors influencing cancellations.
4. Explore the relationship between lead time (booking to check-in) and cancellation likelihood.
5. Develop and evaluate a logistic regression model to predict cancellations.

## 1.2 Research Methods & Expected Outcomes

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Use Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to visualize cancellation patterns and identify key trends.
* **Statistical Modeling:** Build a logistic regression model to quantify the impact of each factor on cancellation probability.
* **Optimization Strategy:** Identify and prioritize interventions based on model insights (e.g., targeted communication strategies for high-risk bookings).

**Expected Impact:**

* Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce cancellation rates.
* Enhance room occupancy forecasting and revenue management.
* Offer actionable insights that hotel operations can implement to improve profitability and guest satisfaction.
